I am a political economic geographer with substantive interests in geospatial data, media, and technologies. My research integrates the geographic, political, and regulatory dimensions of the informational and digital economy. At a high level, this research agenda is motivated by three core questions:

1) How are digital economies geographically configured and integrated into capitalism?

2) How do geospatial data, media, and technologies circulate through and transform these digital economies?

3) How are social relations and possibilities for political action rearticulated in the (geospatial) digital economy?

I am currently exploring answers to these questions through research projects addressing (among others) the geographies of autonomous vehicles, and the changing political economy of remote sensing in the context of the small satellite revolution.
