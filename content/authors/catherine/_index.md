I'm a postdoctoral scholar and mapmaker at Dartmouth College! I make maps, teach mapmaking, and rethink mapping practice. My dissertation explores the intersections of mapping and feminist theory. Broadly, I ask: what is feminist mapping and how can we apply feminist principles across spatial data, map design, and mapping processes?
