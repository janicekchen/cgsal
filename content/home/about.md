CGSAL @ Dartmouth College studies the critical dimensions of spatial data science, particularly the political economy of geospatial data, media, and technologies. Currently the lab is developing projects related to the various geospatial aspects of remotely sensed imagery and the micro-satellite revolution, just transitions relating to transportation infrastucture, as well as the development and impacts of autonomous vehicles.
